# my-first-repository
This is my first respository when I will practice doing some little projects.


The first exercise is to make from a list to extract the maximum by means of an algorithm without the max() function, to order from a list of numbers
At the end I will make a small project like main() in Python of computer mechanisms: bubble, insertion and another one.
